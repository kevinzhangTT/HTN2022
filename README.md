# Hack the North 2022 - Ocularity
Overloaded restaurant menus have been problematic for owners and customers alike. Having too many menu items leaves customers confused about what to pick, making it less likely for them to return in the future. We wanted to help restaurant owners to see which menu items to remove, while also keeping their signature dishes.

## ✨ About
Using eye-tracking, the user is able to gather analytics to which menu items customers spend the most time looking at. A heatmap is generated to visualize this.
